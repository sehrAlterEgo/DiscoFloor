How To:

* Add the word Disco to the name of the lcds you want affected
* load the script
* Disco!

if you want to change the number of squares per row go into the programmable block's properties, type a number in the argument list and hit run.

It assumes a square LCD, so it'll probably look a bit weird on the wide ones, but who am I to stop you from partying however you want to?!
